How to compile:

g++ -o dijkstra dijkstra.cpp

How to run:

./dijkstra fileName nodeSize startNode

fileName is the file containing the adjacency matrix  
nodeSize is the number of nodes
startNode is the starting node from 0 to nodeSize-1

Design:

In my program, I changed the nodes from letters to numbers in alphabetical order. So in the topology from the question b), the nodes t-z became 0-6. I also chose to represent any nodes without edges with -1 instead of a large number, because it was easier to write out the matrices in the text files. 

The folder contains the files with the adjacency matrices for questions a) b) and c).
To run question a) with starting node U, run it as:

./dijkstra aMatrix 6 0

and it should output the table followed by "Shortest path: 0, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5" corresponding to u,x,v,y,w,z. My program broke the tie between y and v by favoring v instead, which is why it has a different table to the textbook.
